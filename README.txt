INTRODUCTION
------------

Social Auth WeChat Module is a WeChat Authentication integration for Drupal. It
is based on the Social Auth and Social API projects. This module serves as a
guide to create new implementers for Social Auth.

It adds to the site:
* A new url: /user/login/wechat.
* A settings form on /admin/config/social-api/social-auth/wechat page.
* A WeChat Logo in the Social Auth Login block.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires the following modules:

 * Social Auth (https://drupal.org/project/social_auth)
 * Social API (https://drupal.org/project/social_api)

INSTALLATION
------------

 * Add the drupal.org repository:
   composer config repositories.drupal composer https://packages.drupal.org/8

 * Download overtrue/wechat SDK
   (https://github.com/overtrue/wechat).

 * Use composer module to install the library:
   composer require "drupal/social_auth_wechat:2.x-dev"

 * Install the dependencies: Social API and Social Auth.

 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See:
   https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8
   for further information.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

 * Add your WeChat project OAuth information in
   Configuration » User Authentication » WeChat.

 * Place a Social Auth Login block in Structure » Block Layout.

 * If you already have a Social Auth Login block in the site, rebuild the cache.


HOW IT WORKS
------------

Users can click on the WeChat logo on the Social Auth Login block
You can also add a button or link anywhere on the site that points
to /user/login/wechat, so theming and customizing the button or link
is very flexible.

When the user opens the /user/login/wechat link, it automatically takes
the user to WeChat Accounts for authentication. WeChat then returns the user to
Drupal site. If we have an existing Drupal user with the same email address
provided by WeChat, that user is logged in. Otherwise a new Drupal user is
created.
